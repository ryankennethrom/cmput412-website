We see that the camera and motors seem to respond to our inputs. The next step is to calibrate them. The purpose of calibrating camera and motors is to account for manufacturing inconsistencies. Just because there is inaccurate output when controlling the duckiebot doesn't mean that it is unusable. We can fix the inconsistencies through manual calibration to some extent. </p>"},{"location":"ex1/#dashboard-screenshot","title":"Dashboard Screenshot","text":""},{"location":"ex1/#dashboard-video","title":"Dashboard Video","text":""},{"location":"ex1/#calibrating-the-camera","title":"Calibrating the Camera","text":"<p>Calibrating the camera makes sure that the robot receive accurate representation of its environment. The duckiebot's camera calibration is simplified and only needed us to move the robot's position and camera angles with respect to an image designed for calibrating it. After calibrating the camera, the robot generated the following files.</p>"},{"location":"ex1/#camera-intrinsic-yaml","title":"camera intrinsic yaml","text":""},{"location":"ex1/#camera-extrinsic-yaml","title":"camera extrinsic yaml","text":""},{"location":"ex1/#calibrating-the-wheels","title":"Calibrating the Wheels","text":"<p>We calibrated our duckiebot's wheels by repeatedly setting different values to its gain and trim parameters in the terminal.

It was especially hard to figure out how to correctly set the parameters to keep the duckiebot dead center. After discussing with the TAs, we realized it might be because of the uneven platform beneath the robot. One way to fix this is to increase the gain parameter increasing the average speed of the robot.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"ex1/#lane-following","title":"Lane Following","text":"<p>The duckiebot provides an easy to setup lane following demo. We only needed to place the duckiebot on the right side of a particularly designed lane and after some commands in the terminal, we pressed \"a\" to start the demo. We initially had a hiccup in this part since when we started the demo it moved only a few centimeters before stopping completely. After increasing the gain from 1.0 to 2.0, we are able to achieve a pretty good result.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"ex1/#running-a-python-program-in-the-robot","title":"Running a python program in the robot","text":"<p>One main and very useful features of docker is for quick and easy recreation of environments that our programs are built and expected to work on. After finishing writing the program for the duckiebot, we used two docker commands to build our program and run it on the robot itself.
